According to Google:

> These reports show how visits and length of stay at different places change
> compared to a baseline. We calculate these changes using the same kind of
> aggregated and anonymized data used to show popular times for places in Google
> Maps.
> - The baseline is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week,
>   during the 5-week period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020.
> - The reports show trends over several weeks with the most recent data
>   representing approximately 2-3 days ago—this is how long it takes to produce
>   the reports.
